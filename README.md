# NZWalks API

Welcome to the NZWalks API project! This API, developed using ASP.NET C#, serves as a backend solution for managing and exploring walking tracks in New Zealand. I created this project with guidance from an ASP.NET course on Udemy, which provided me with valuable insights and hands-on experience in various key concepts and technologies, including:

- **Authentication**: Implementing secure user authentication to protect sensitive data.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Structuring the code with OOP principles for maintainability and scalability.
- **Controllers & Models**: Creating a clean separation between application logic and data structures.
- **AutoMapper**: Utilizing AutoMapper to simplify object mapping between DTOs and entities.
- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: Designing DTOs to efficiently transfer data between client and server.
- **Repositories**: Applying the repository pattern for data access, promoting separation of concerns.
- **Image Upload**: Enabling image uploads to enhance the user experience with visual content.
- **DbContext & SQL Server**: Working with Entity Framework and SQL Server for data management and migrations.
- **Migrations**: Using Entity Framework migrations to manage database schema changes seamlessly.
- **Filters**: Implementing action filters for better request handling and response management.

This project not only deepened my understanding of backend development but also strengthened my skills in building robust, scalable APIs. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or provide feedback!
